# Camera and Pipeline server
Cam server is an epics - bsread interface that converts epics enabled camera into a bs_read stream. In addition it 
also provides a processing pipeline and a REST interface to control both the cameras and the pipeline.

## Build

<a id="conda_setup"></a>
### Conda setup
If you use conda, you can create an environment with the cam_server library by running:

```bash
conda create -c paulscherrerinstitute --name <env_name> cam_server
```

After that you can just source you newly created environment and start using the server.

<a id="local_build"></a>
### Local build
You can build the library by running the setup script in the root folder of the project:

```bash
python setup.py install
```

or by using the conda also from the root folder of the project:

```bash
conda build conda-recipe
conda install --use-local mflow_node_processors
```

#### Requirements
The library relies on the following packages:

- requests
- bsread >=0.9.3
- bottle
- numpy
- scipy
- pyepics
- matplotlib
- pillow

In case you are using conda to install the packages, you might need to add the **paulscherrerinstitute** channel to 
your conda config:

```
conda config --add channels paulscherrerinstitute
```

<a id="docker_build"></a>
### Docker build
To build the docker image run (from project root):
```bash
./docker/build.sh
```

Before building the docker image, make sure the latest version of the library is available in anaconda.

<a id="basic_concepts"></a>
## Basic concepts

<a id="request_a_stream"></a>
### Requesting a stream and instance management

Instance management is done automatically. Once you request a stream, you have a fixed amount of time 
(no clients timeout) to connect to the stream. If you do not connect in the given time, the stream will automatically 
be stopped. In this case, you will need to request the stream again. 

The same is true when disconnecting from the stream. You do not need to take any actions to close the pipeline or 
camera stream, as they will close themselves automatically after the configured time has elapsed.

There are however 2 methods available for manual instance management:
- stop_instance
- stop_all_instances

They are not meant to be used during normal operations, but only as administrative methods if something does not work 
as expected.

<a id="shared_and_private"></a>
### Shared and private pipeline instances

The difference between shared and private pipeline instances in mainly in the fact that shared instances are 
read only (the pipeline config cannot be changed). This is done to prevent the interaction between different users 
- if 2 people are independently viewing the same pipeline at the same time, we need to prevent to any of them to change 
what the other receives. If you need to change the pipeline parameters, you need to create a private pipeline instance.

Shared instances are named after the pipeline config they are created from. For example, if you have a saved pipeline 
with the name 'simulation_pipeline', the shared instance instance_id will be 'simulation_pipeline'. Private instances 
can have a custom instance_id you provide, or an automatically generated one. 
In any case, the given instance_id must be unique.

You can share the private pipeline as well - all you need to share is the instance_id. But you need to be 
aware that anyone having your instance_id can change any parameter on the pipeline.

<a id="configuration_versioning"></a>
### Configuration versioning and camera background in the pipeline server
We have a requirement to be always able to access the original configuration with which the image was processed.

The configuration used by the pipeline for image processing is explicitly added to each bs_read message. The 
configuration is added as a JSON object (string representation) in the **processing\_parameters** field. 
Since this config is included with every message, there is no need to version the 
processing parameters on the pipeline server. You can retrieve the processing parameters for each frame individually
(the processing parameters can change from frame to frame).

Backgrounds, on the other hand, are not included into this field - just the background id is (since the background is 
a large image, it does not make sense to include it in every message). As a consequence, backgrounds can never be 
deleted and need to be versioned on the pipeline server. All backgrounds need to be backed up regularly.

<a id="configuration"></a>
## Configuration
The camera and pipeline instances have their own configuration which can be read and set via the rest interface.
We currently store the configurations in files, but REDIS is planned to be used in the near future.

The expected folder structure for the configuration (which can be changed by passing parameters to the executables):

- configuration/camera : Folder where JSON files with camera configurations are located.
- configuration/pipeline : Folder where JSON files with pipeline configurations are located.
- configuration/background : Folder where NPY files with camera backgrounds are located.

<a id="camera_configuration"></a>
### Camera configuration
For camera configuration, all fields must be specified, and there is no defaulting in case some are missing.

#### Configuration parameters

- **name**: Name of the camera.
- **prefix**: PV prefix to connect to the camera.
- **mirror\_x**: Mirror camera image over X axis.
- **mirror\_y**: Mirror camera image over Y axis.
- **rotate**: how many times to rotate the camera image by 90 degrees.

#### Example
```json
{
  "name": "example_4",
  "prefix": "EPICS_example_4",
  "mirror_x": true,
  "mirror_y": false,
  "rotate": 4
}
```

<a id="pipeline_configuration"></a>
### Pipeline configuration

Configuration changes can for the pipeline can be incremental - you need to specify only the fields that you want 
to change. A valid configuration must have only the **camera_name** specified, all other fields will be 
defaulted to **None** (or False, in the case of "image_background_enable"). The complete configuration used for the 
pipeline is added to the output bsread stream in the 
**processing\_parameters** field.

#### Configuration parameters

- **camera\_name** : Name of the camera to use as a pipeline source.
- **camera\_calibration** (Default _None_): Info on how to convert the camera pixels into engineering units.
    - reference_marker (Default _[0, 0, 100, 100]_): Reference markers placement.
    - reference_marker_width (Default _100.0_): Width of reference markers.
    - reference_marker_height (Default _100.0_): Height of reference markers.
    - angle_horizontal (Default _0.0_): Horizontal angle.
    - angle_vertical (Default _0.0_): Vertical angle.
- **image\_background** (Default _None_): Background to subtract from the original image.
- **image\_background_enable** (Default _False_): Enable or disale the image_background subtraction.
- **image\_threshold** (Default _None_): Minimum value of each pixel. Pixels below the threshold are converted to 0.
- **image\_region\_of\_interest** (Default _None_): Crop the image before processing.
- **image\_good\_region** (Default _None_): Good region to use for fits and slices.
    - threshold (Default _0.3_): Threshold to apply on each pixel.
    - gfscale (Default _1.8_): Scale to extend the good region.
- **image\_slices** (Default _None_): 
    - number_of_slices (Default _1_): Desired number of slices.
    - scale (Default _2.0_): Good region scale in for slicing purposes.

#### Example
```json
{
  "camera_name": "simulation",

  "camera_calibration": {
    "reference_marker": [ 0, 0, 100, 100 ],
    "reference_marker_width": 100.0,
    "reference_marker_height": 100.0,
    "angle_horizontal": 0.0,
    "angle_vertical": 0.0
  },

  "image_background": null,
  "image_background_enable": false,
  "image_threshold": 0.5,
  "image_region_of_interest": [0, 100, 0, 100],

  "image_good_region": {
    "threshold": 0.9,
    "gfscale": 3
  },

  "image_slices": {
    "number_of_slices": 1,
    "scale": 1.0
  }
}
```

<a id="web_interface"></a>
## Web interface
The cam_server is divided into 2 parts:

- Camera server (default: localhost:8888)
- Pipeline server (default: localhost:8889)

Operations on both server are accessible via the REST api and also via a python client class (that calls the REST api).

As an end user you should interact mostly with the pipeline, with the exception of cases where you need the raw 
image coming directly from the camera - even in this case, it is advisable to create a new pipeline without processing 
and use the stream from the pipeline. In this way, we lower the network load on the system (only one instance of 
camera stream, that is shared by many pipelines).

All request (with the exception of **get\_camera\_image**) return a JSON with the following fields:
- **state** - \["ok", "error"\]
- **status** - What happened on the server or error message, depending on the state.
- Optional request specific field - \["cameras", "geometry", "info", "stream", "config", "pipelines", 
"instance_id", "background_id"\]

For more information on what each command does check the **API** section in this document.

## Running the servers

The scripts for running the existing server are located under the **cam\_server/** folder.

The two servers are:

- **Camera server** (start_camera_server.py): Converts epics cameras into bsread cameras.
- **Pipeline server** (start_pipeline_server.py): Processes cameras in bsread format.

You can also use the docker container directly - it setups and starts both servers.

Before you can run the servers, you need to have (and specify where you have it) the cameras, pipelines and background 
configurations. In this repo, you can find the test configurations inside the **tests/** folder. To use the 
production configuration, see **Production configuration** chapter below.

<a id="run_camera_server"></a>
### Camera server

```bash
usage: start_camera_server.py [-h] [-p PORT] [-i INTERFACE] [-b BASE]
                              [-n HOSTNAME]
                              [--log_level {CRITICAL,ERROR,WARNING,INFO,DEBUG}]

Camera acquisition server

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

                        Log level to use.

```

<a id="run_docker_container"></a>
### Docker container
To execute the application inside a docker container, you must first start it (from the project root folder):
```bash
docker run --net=host -it -v /CURRENT_DIR/tests:/configuration docker.psi.ch:5000/cam_server
```

**WARNING**: Docker needs (at least on OSX) a full path for the -v option. Replace the **CURRENT\_DIR** with your 
actual path.

This will map the test configuration (-v option) to the /configuration folder inside the container. 
If you need to have the production configuration, see the next chapter.

Once in the container bash, you can start the two servers:
```bash
camera_server & pipeline_server &
```

<a id="production_configuration"></a>
## Production configuration

The production configurations are not part of this repository but are available on:
- https://git.psi.ch/controls_highlevel_applications/cam_server_configuration

You can download it using git:
```bash
git clone https://git.psi.ch/controls_highlevel_applications/cam_server_configuration.git
```

And later, when you start the docker container, map the configuration using the **-v** parameter:
```bash
docker run --net=host -it -v /CURRENT_DIR/cam_server_configuration/configuration:/configuration docker.psi.ch:5000/cam_server
```

**WARNING**: Docker needs (at least on OSX) a full path for the -v option. Replace the **CURRENT\_DIR** with your 
actual path.

## Examples

<a id="get_simulation_camera_stream"></a>
### Get the simulation camera stream

This is just an example on how you can retrieve the raw image from the camera. You **should not** do this for 
the normal use case. See next example for a more common use.

```python
from cam_server import CamClient
from cam_server.utils import get_host_port_from_stream_address
from bsread import source, SUB

# Change to match your camera server
server_address = "http://0.0.0.0:8888"

# Initialize the client.
camera_client = CamClient(server_address)

# Get stream address of simulation camera. Stream address in format tcp://hostname:port.
camera_stream_address = camera_client.get_camera_stream("simulation")

# Extract the stream hostname and port from the stream address.
camera_host, camera_port = get_host_port_from_stream_address(camera_stream_address)

# Subscribe to the stream.
with source(host=camera_host, port=camera_port, mode=SUB) as stream:
    # Receive next message.
    data = stream.receive()

image_width = data.data.data["width"].value

### Get a basic pipeline with a simulated camera

In contrast with the example above, where we just request a camera stream, we have to create a pipeline instance 
in this example. We create a pipeline instance by specifying which camera - simulation in our example - to use as 
the pipeline source.

By not giving any additional pipeline parameters, the image will in fact be exactly the same as the one in the 
previous example. Even if requesting a raw camera image, it is still advisable to use the PipelineClient (and create 
an empty pipeline as in the example below) because the CamClient might change and be moved to a different server out 
of your reach.

```python
from cam_server import PipelineClient
from cam_server.utils import get_host_port_from_stream_address
from bsread import source, SUB

# Change to match your pipeline server
server_address = "http://0.0.0.0:8889"

# Initialize the client.
pipeline_client = PipelineClient(server_address)

# Setup the pipeline config. Use the simulation camera as the pipeline source.
pipeline_config = {"camera_name": "simulation"}

# Create a new pipeline with the provided configuration. Stream address in format tcp://hostname:port.
instance_id, pipeline_stream_address = pipeline_client.create_instance_from_config(pipeline_config)

# Extract the stream hostname and port from the stream address.
pipeline_host, pipeline_port = get_host_port_from_stream_address(pipeline_stream_address)

# Subscribe to the stream.
with source(host=pipeline_host, port=pipeline_port, mode=SUB) as stream:
    # Receive next message.
    data = stream.receive()

image_width = data.data.data["width"].value
image_height = data.data.data["height"].value
image_bytes = data.data.data["image"].value

print("Image size: %d x %d" % (image_width, image_height))
print("Image data: %s" % image_bytes)
```

### Create a pipeline instance with background

This example is the continuation of the previous example. Before creating our own pipeline, we collect the 
background for the simulation camera and apply it to the pipeline.

```python
from cam_server import PipelineClient
from cam_server.utils import get_host_port_from_stream_address
from bsread import source, SUB

# Change to match your pipeline server
server_address = "http://0.0.0.0:8889"
camera_name = "simulation"

# Initialize the client.
pipeline_client = PipelineClient(server_address)

# Collect the background for the given camera.
background_id = pipeline_client.collect_background(camera_name)

# Setup the pipeline config. Use the simulation camera as the pipeline source, and the collected background.
pipeline_config = {"camera_name": camera_name,
                   "background_id": background_id}

# Create a new pipeline with the provided configuration. Stream address in format tcp://hostname:port.
instance_id, pipeline_stream_address = pipeline_client.create_instance_from_config(pipeline_config)

# TODO: Continue as in the example above.
```
